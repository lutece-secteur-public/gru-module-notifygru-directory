##Introduction
The resource provider (directory) Directory NotifyGru makes the link between the task and the Directory NotifyGru plugin. Indeed, NotifyGru is designed to operate with any implementation of the abstract class `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.workflow.modules.notifygru.service.AbstractServiceProvider` Itself implements the interface `fr.paris.lutece.plugins.workflow.modules.notifygru.service.IProvider` which defines the basic methods of providers.
##Implementation

Module Notify Gru Directory Manager is implemented resource providers (directory), that is to say, only one instance of a manager provides for each directory, a provider instance.This has the consequence of having a property value `managerProvider` always `FALSE` to indicate that we have a manager provider instance of this service

In the context file, we like reporting BEAN : `` 

##Configuration



##Provider use

When the task is originally created and the selected provider, the instance of the latter gives the information available via bookmarks.. These bookmarks can be used to set messages or objects of different tabs :

 
* title field 1 ${position_1}
* title field 2 ${position_2}
* .........
* title field n ${position_n}

When performing the task NotifyGru, the provider instance provides all the necessary information to build the JSON stream.
